            <p>Flux is a unique way to measure changes in Google search results, filtering out the noise to score SERP changes based on recent history.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Unlike generic visibility metrics, Flux provides a tailored analysis grounded in your tracked campaign keywords, giving you your own personal SERP barometer.</p>
            <p>Sometimes significant changes align with Google core updates or shifts in search features. At other times, changes happen naturally as websites drop in and out of competition, reflecting the organic ebb and flow of the SERPs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We use a <b>flux score</b> to demonstrate this flow. This is a normalised value which keeps it easy to read, and simple to comprehend.</p>
            <p>High scores on a given day reflect significant activity, while lower scores indicate a more stable landscape.</p>
            <p><b>Flux points</b> are similar to traditional visibility scores, where more points indicate that a domain or search feature is more prominent.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Explore Flux by using the category and device filter buttons to see how different niches have evolved over time. Whether you're analysing desktop or mobile trends, Flux reveals a deeper understanding of SERP dynamics and competition in your niche.</p>

                    <p>The Flux Score chart offers a long-term view of fluctuations in search rankings. This visualisation helps identify major shifts at the keyword category level, making it easy to spot patterns over time. Key algorithm updates and significant events are labelled to provide additional context, helping you correlate score spikes with industry-wide changes.</p>

                    <h2>Flux Wheel</h2>
                    <p>The Flux Wheel is a unique visualisation that captures the magnitude of day-on-day SERP changes. Each particle represents a domain, and its position relative to the central ring shows its change in visibility: <b>the further from the ring, the more significant the positive or negative change.</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This visualisation focuses on domain-level changes for desktop or mobile, highlighting shifts in overall prominence. Days are represented clockwise, and key ranking update days are marked with solid lines for quick reference.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For now, this visualisation is locked to an overall assessent of top domains, split by desktop and mobile SERPs.</p>

                    <h2>Top Search Features</h2>
                    <p>The Top Search Features chart tracks the prevalence of search features over time. By analysing these trends, you can identify shifts in the types of results dominating the SERPs, such as shopping carousels, featured snippets, or video results.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This chart helps you understand how changes in search features align with significant Google updates. For example, a sudden increase in shopping carousels might coincide with an update that prioritises transactional search intent.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>These tables help identify trends and anomalies at a glance. A sudden visibility gain might indicate a successful campaign or a new content strategy, while a drop could suggest a penalty or loss of ranking due to increased competition.</p>
